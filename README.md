# House-Price-Prediction
The real estate market in Bangalore is highly dynamic, influenced by factors such as location, size, and demand. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features like total square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and location. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains 13,320 records with relevant attributes.
To ensure the modelâ€™s accuracy, the project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier removal, and machine learning model selection, leading to a robust prediction system.
